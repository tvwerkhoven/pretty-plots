Tim's plot examples
===================

These are some small scripts in Gnuplot and Python/matplotlib to plot nice figures. Most of the plots are aimed at using Paul Tol's optimal colour schemes as described on his homepage at <http://www.sron.nl/~pault/>.

Note that for matplotlib, the colour schemes RdYlBu, YlOrBr and Spectral are close to the colour schemes Paul Tol proposes.
